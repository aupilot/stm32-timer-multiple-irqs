# Example of using a timer for multiple time dependent events  

This is a demo code for my blog's post below.<p>Specifically, this is how I implemented precise timing scheduler for a TDMA application.
It's written for STM NUCLEO-L152RE development board, but can be easily ported to any STM32 microcontroller.<p>
